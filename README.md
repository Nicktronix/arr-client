## 🚀 Quick Start

### Download Pre-Built APK

**For Android users**: Download the latest APK from [Releases](https://github.com/Nicktronix/arr-client/releases) - no Flutter SDK required!

### Build from Source

**Prerequisites**: [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) 3.38.5 or higher

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nicktronix/arr-client.git
   cd arr-client
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   # Android
   flutter run -d android
   
   # iOS (requires macOS with Xcode)
   flutter run -d ios
   ```

### First-Time Setup

1. Launch the app (you'll see an empty state)
2. Tap the **settings icon** (⚙️) in the top-right
3. Add your Sonarr/Radarr instance(s):
   - **Name**: e.g., "Home Sonarr"
   - **URL**: Your instance URL (e.g., `https://sonarr.example.com`)
   - **API Key**: Found in Sonarr/Radarr → Settings → General → Security
   - **Optional**: Enable Basic Auth if using a proxy
4. Select the active instance with the radio button
5. Return to home screen and start browsing!

## 🏗️ Architecture

Built with a custom centralized state management pattern:
- **AppStateManager**: Single source of truth for active instances
- **CacheManager**: 5-minute memory cache with stale-while-revalidate
- **CachedDataLoader**: Mixin pattern for consistent loading states
- **Instance-aware caching**: Isolated cache per instance for performance

See [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Empty screens on first launch?**
- This is expected! Tap the settings icon (⚙️) to add your first instance.

**"Unauthorized" error?**
- Check your API key in Sonarr/Radarr → Settings → General → Security

**"Not found" error?**
- Verify your base URL (should be `https://sonarr.example.com`, not `/api/v3`)

**Can't connect?**
- Test the URL in your browser first
- Check firewall/network settings
- Ensure you can reach the server from your device

## 🔒 Security

- **Credential Storage**: API keys stored in platform keychain/keystore (hardware-encrypted)
- **Biometric Lock**: Optional Face ID/Touch ID/fingerprint authentication
- **Encrypted Backups**: AES-256-GCM with 600k PBKDF2 iterations (OWASP 2023 compliant)
- **Network**: HTTPS support with certificate validation
- **Zero vulnerabilities**: Comprehensive security audit completed (Dec 2025)
