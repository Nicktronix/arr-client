# Arr Client — Claude Code Instructions

## Context files

Local context files (`.claude/context/`) provide detailed reference on demand:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `architecture.md` | Code examples: CachedDataLoader, service singletons, three-state pattern, release dialog, API endpoints, auth headers, encryption specs |
| `branching-strategy.md` | Branch model, naming rules, PR targets, full issue→branch→PR lifecycle |
| `workflows.md` | Daily dev commands, pre-commit checklist, feature development steps, test commands |
| `github-project.md` | Project ID, field IDs, status option IDs, label definitions |

## Documentation policy

- **README.md** — user-facing: setup, features, troubleshooting
- **RELEASE.md** — release process and CI/CD workflow guide
- **CLAUDE.md** — this file: architecture overview and development patterns
- Do not create additional doc files. Answer questions in chat; update README only for core user-facing changes.

## Architecture overview

Three core singletons form the foundation:

**`AppStateManager`** (`lib/services/app_state_manager.dart`)
Single source of truth for active instances. `ChangeNotifier` that broadcasts instance changes and coordinates cache invalidation. Never access `InstanceManager` directly from screens — always go through `AppStateManager`.

**`CacheManager`** (`lib/services/cache_manager.dart`)
In-memory cache with instance-aware keys (e.g. `series_list_instance123`). 5-minute validity with stale-while-revalidate. Cache keys must be globally unique across all screens.

**`CachedDataLoader`** (`lib/utils/cached_data_loader.dart`)
Mixin for all data-loading screens. Provides the standard loading → loaded/error/empty pattern, cache checking, and background refresh. See `architecture.md` for full usage example.

**Service layer** (`SonarrService`, `RadarrService`)
Singleton API clients that listen to `AppStateManager` and auto-reset their `ApiClient` when the active instance changes. Lazy initialisation on first use.

**No typed models** — API responses use `Map<String, dynamic>` and `List<dynamic>` throughout. The only exception is `ServiceInstance` for credential management.

## Code conventions

**Naming**
- Classes: `PascalCase` — screens: `FeatureNameScreen`, services: `ServiceNameService`, state: `_FeatureNameScreenState`
- Files: `snake_case.dart`
- Private members: `_prefixed`

**File organisation**
- One main widget per file; related helpers in the same file
- No barrel exports — direct imports everywhere
- Absolute imports from `lib/`

**State management**
- `setState()` only — no Provider, Bloc, Riverpod, or any library
- All data screens use `CachedDataLoader` mixin
- Services are singletons; screens never instantiate them with `new`

**Data access**
- Always null-check: `data['field'] ?? 'default'`
- Always check lists: `(data['list'] as List?)?.length ?? 0`
- Always check `mounted` before `setState()` after async operations

**Error handling**
- Always use `ErrorFormatter.format(e)` for user-facing messages
- Every error state must have a retry button

**Navigation**
- `MaterialPageRoute` with direct constructors — no named routes

---

## Security rules

- **Never commit** API keys, passwords, tokens, real instance URLs, or backup passwords
- Credentials → `flutter_secure_storage` only
- Metadata (names, URLs) → `SharedPreferences`
- `ErrorFormatter` sanitizes credentials from error messages automatically

---

## Common pitfalls

1. Use `CachedDataLoader` for data screens — don't implement manual loading states
2. Never access `InstanceManager` directly from screens — use `AppStateManager`
3. Cache keys must be globally unique (instance suffix is the same per service, two screens with the same base key collide)
4. `RefreshIndicator` requires a scrollable child (ListView, CustomScrollView, etc.)
5. Empty state ≠ error state — different icons, messages, and CTAs
6. Service reset is automatic — `AppStateManager` calls `reset()` on instance changes
7. All crypto must run in isolates via `compute()` — never on the UI thread
8. `saveFile()` on mobile requires the `bytes` parameter; desktop uses the returned path
